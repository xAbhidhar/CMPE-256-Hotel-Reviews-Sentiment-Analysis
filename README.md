## Sentiment analysis

## Implementation
### Data collection and Data Preprocesing
The data has been cleaned with the removal of the unicode and punctuations in the text data and transforming the text into lower case. Also as a part of preprocessing step, the stopwords has also been removed. Out of all the features, the features which has no effect on the rating has been dropped as a part of dimentionality reduction. After this, it is converted into to pandas dataframe with required features.
